## Installing EWD.js

       npm install ewdjs

In the node_modules/ewdjs directory that is created, you'll find a file named install.js.  It is 
recommended that you run this in order to create the run-time environment and to move the files in
the repository to their correct run-time destinations.  From within node_modules/ewdjs, run the following:

       node install
